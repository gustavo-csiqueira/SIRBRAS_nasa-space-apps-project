            <h3>Why manufacture in space?</h3>
            <p>In-space manufacturing exploits key characteristics of LEO, such as microgravity and lack of atmosphere, to enable the creation of previously impossible materials while also improving the quality of high-precision processes.
                Microgravity is the primary characteristic exploited to achieve a level of structural perfection impossible on Earth. In the absence of gravity, the forces of convection and sedimentation disappear. For crystalline silicon, this means that during the cooling of molten material, there are no convection currents to disturb the uniform formation of the crystal lattice, eliminating defects and dislocations. This allows for the growth of larger, flawless wafers with superior electronic properties. Similarly, for protein crystals, molecules in a solution are no longer pulled down by gravity or stirred by convection. Instead, they can assemble slowly and methodically via diffusion, resulting in large, highly-ordered crystals that are ideal for X-ray crystallography, which dramatically accelerates the design of new pharmaceuticals.

                The extreme vacuum of space provides an ultra-pristine environment that is a significant advantage for high-purity manufacturing. When producing crystalline silicon, even the best terrestrial cleanrooms contain trace atmospheric gases that can introduce atomic-level impurities into the material, degrading its performance. The hard vacuum of space is a naturally perfect cleanroom, preventing these contaminants from integrating into the silicon wafer during its formation or during sensitive thin-film deposition processes. While less critical for protein crystallization, this pristine environment also ensures that sensitive biological samples are protected from oxidative damage and other atmospheric reactions, preserving their integrity throughout the manufacturing process.

                Finally, the inherent sterility of a sealed, isolated space-based facility is a crucial benefit, particularly for biomanufacturing. Producing pharmaceutical-grade protein crystals requires an environment completely free of biological contaminants like bacteria, viruses, or fungi, a condition that is costly and difficult to maintain on Earth. In space, the closed-loop system of a manufacturing module provides the ultimate aseptic environment, virtually eliminating the risk of contamination. This not only ensures the purity and safety of materials intended for therapeutic use but also improves the yield for semiconductor manufacturing, as the absence of terrestrial dust, microbes, and other particulates prevents defects that could ruin intricate circuitry.

            <h3>How we operate</h3>
            <p>SIRBRAS aims to offer microgravity as a service. Our plan is to build a Modular Microgravity Lab (MML), containing a multitude of manufacturing tools which will be used to fabricate high-precision and high-quality products. Other companies would hire this service, which would consist of:
                1. Collecting raw material on Earth and transporting it to a MML. This material must be provided by the client company.
                2. Our machinery within the lab processes the raw material and crafts the refined product.
                3. The refined product along with subproducts is collected by a transport vessel, which is safely brought back to Earth. Notice that taking raw material to the Lab and bringing back the products can be done by the same vessel, in order to make the whole process more efficient.
                4. SIRBRAS collects the refined product within the vessel and delivers it to the costumer.
