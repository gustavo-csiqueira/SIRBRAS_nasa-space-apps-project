                <img src="assets/img/CrystalComparison.jpg" alt="">
                <p>On Earth, gravity is the invisible barrier to perfection. It introduces defects into silicon crystals and impurities into vital medicines, limiting the performance of our electronics and the efficacy of healthcare. For decades, the most advanced industries have been constrained by this fundamental force.</p>

                <h3>The Orbital Advantage: The Planned Modular Microgravity Laboratory</h3>
                <p>We are designing the solution: an isolated, controlled, and fully automated manufacturing facility planned for Low Earth Orbit. Our LMM will be a pristine environment, free from the vibrations and contamination that plague existing platforms. By removing gravity from the equation, our goal is to unlock a new era of molecularly perfect production.</p>

                    <p>
                        The goal is to achieve a level of purity and structural perfection in Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) that is currently unattainable.<br>
                        In the absence of gravity-driven convection, crystals will be able to grow with near-perfect uniformity, free from inclusions and defects.<br>
                        This will lead to drugs with potentially higher efficacy, stability, and better performance.

                <h3>For Semiconductors</h3>
                <p>
                    We plan to enable the production of silicon wafers with a near-flawless crystal structure, eliminating imperfections caused by gravitational stress. <br>
                    This will result in chips with higher performance due to faster electron mobility.<br>
                    The process will drastically improve energy efficiency, as a perfect crystal lattice offers minimal electrical resistance.<br>
                    This will also increase production yields by reducing the number of chips discarded due to undetectable internal flaws.
